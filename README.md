# agentic-coding-methodology

My methodology for working with coding agents on projects that run for months
and thousands of chat messages. It solves one problem: in week twelve, neither
I nor the agent remembers why something was decided in week three.

Core idea: context is the scarce resource. After every task, the relevant
knowledge is written to files in the repo — each with a defined load behavior
(always / targeted / on demand). Every fresh session reads those files and
continues where the last one stopped. Forgetting is fine; losing the *why* is not.

**The full explanation, with diagrams:**

## Harnesses

`AGENTS.md` is the tool-agnostic contract and `docs/agentcontext/` is plain
Markdown — the methodology itself doesn't care which agent runs it. A harness
is only the wiring that makes a given tool load those files: Cursor reads
`AGENTS.md` directly; Claude Code gets a thin `CLAUDE.md` pointer plus a
SessionStart hook so nothing is written twice. `/setup-project` asks which
harness to wire — there is no default. See `harnesses/`: one small file per
harness, and adding another (e.g. codex) is one more.

## Quick start

1. Make the skills available globally (once), for your harness.

   Cursor:

   ```bash
   ln -s <clone>/skills/setup-project  ~/.cursor/skills/setup-project
   ln -s <clone>/skills/update-project ~/.cursor/skills/update-project
   ```

   Claude Code:

   ```bash
   ln -s <clone>/skills/setup-project  ~/.claude/skills/setup-project
   ln -s <clone>/skills/update-project ~/.claude/skills/update-project
   ```

   Then wire the global preferences. Both harnesses point at the same
   versioned `global/AGENTS.md` and keep machine-private facts below the
   import — Cursor via `~/.cursor/rules/agentic-coding.mdc` (template:
   `global/cursor.rule.mdc`), Claude Code via an `@`-import in
   `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

2. In any new project, run:

   ```
   /setup-project
   ```

   It asks which harness to wire (cursor / claude / both) plus two short
   question rounds, then scaffolds `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agentcontext/`, and the
   `/handoff` skill from the templates in this repo — as a single revertible
   commit.

## Layout

```
AGENTS.md                # this repo's own working rules
METHODOLOGY.md           # the concept: workflow, file roles, principles
global/                  # user-level preferences
  AGENTS.md              # versioned prefs
  cursor.rule.mdc        # alwaysApply wrapper for ~/.cursor/rules/
templates/               # source of truth for scaffolded files
  AGENTS.project.md      # project-level AGENTS.md template
  agentcontext/          # PROJECT, DETAILS, HISTORY, TESTING templates
skills/
  setup-project/         # scaffolds the methodology into a repo
  update-project/        # pulls methodology updates into a scaffolded repo
  handoff/               # ends a session cleanly, persists the session delta
harnesses/               # per-tool wiring (contract file, skills, local rules)
  README.md              # the harness contract + mapping table
  cursor.md              # Cursor wiring
  claude.md              # Claude Code wiring
variants/                # deltas on the core: work (license rules), thesis (planned)
```

The `docs/agentcontext/` file structure is plain Markdown and tool-agnostic;
only the thin harness wrapper differs per tool.

## Status

Generic, harness-neutral core (Cursor and Claude Code), plus the work variant's
license rules. Remaining work deltas (team conventions) and the thesis variant
are planned — see `variants/README.md`.
